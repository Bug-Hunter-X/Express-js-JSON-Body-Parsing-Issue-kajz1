This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where the request body is not parsed correctly when the Content-Type header is missing or incorrect. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version. The issue arises because Express.js's `express.json()` middleware requires a valid Content-Type header to properly parse the JSON data.  Without the correct header, the `req.body` remains empty, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.
